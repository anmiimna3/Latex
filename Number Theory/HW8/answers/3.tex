\begin{enumerate}[label=]
   \item 
      For any $a \in \NN$, Let $m = a + 1$ and $n = a $. Then $2mn, m^2 - n^2, m^2 + n^2$ form a triangle.
      Now note that:
      \begin{gather*}
         m^2 - 2mn + n^2 = (m - n)^2 = (a + 1 - a)^2 = 1 \\
         \implies m^2 + n^2 = 2mn + 1
      \end{gather*}
      Which shows that for any $a$ we have a triple, with two consecutives numbers.
