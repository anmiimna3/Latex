    \item 
        First we find a single rational point. Namely $p = (1, 0)$. Now any rational line passing through $p$ meets the curve in another rational point. And this way we can find all rational points on the curve. Thus we only have to find all rational lines passing through $p$. Let $y = mx + b$ where $m, b \in \QQ$. we have:
        \begin{gather*}
            0 = m \times 1 + b \implies b = -m
        \end{gather*}
        Now we have to find the other point of intersection:
        \begin{gather*}
            x^2 - 2(mx - m)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 - 2m^2 x^2 + 4m^2 x - 2m^2 - 1= 0 \\
            \implies (1 - 2m^2) x^2 + 4m^2 x - 2m^2 - 1 = 0
        \end{gather*}
        And we know that $\frac{2m^2 + 1}{2m^2 - 1}$ is the product of roots of this polynomial, and since $1$ is one of the roots, then the other is $\frac{2m^2 + 1}{2m^2 - 1}$. Whic is the $x$ of the other intersection of the line with the curve. Now since $m \in \QQ$, then we have: $m = \frac{a}{b}$, and rewrite:
        \begin{gather*}
            \frac{2m^2 + 1}{2m^2 - 1} = 1 + \frac{2}{2m^2 - 1} = 1 + \frac{2}{\frac{2a^2 - b^2}{b^2}} = 1 + \frac{2b^2 }{2a^2 - b^2}
        \end{gather*}
        As for the $y$ of this intersection, it is $\frac{2m}{2m^2 - 1}$:
        \begin{gather*}
            \frac{2m}{2m^2 - 1} = \frac{\frac{2a}{b}}{\frac{2a^2 - b^2}{b^2}} = \frac{2ab}{2a^2 - b^2}
        \end{gather*}
        Thus for any $a \in \ZZ$ and $b \in \NN$, $(1 + \frac{2b^2}{2a^2 - b^2}, \frac{2ab}{2a^2 - b^2})$ is a rational point on the curve, and it's all of the rational points.
