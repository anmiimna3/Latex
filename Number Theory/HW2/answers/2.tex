    \item 
        Let $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k$ be primes and let $x$ be the answer to this system of equations:
        \begin{gather*}
            x \overset{p_1^2}{\equiv} -1 \\
            x \overset{p_2^2}{\equiv} -2 \\
            \vdots \\
            x \overset{p_k^2}{\equiv} -k
        \end{gather*}
        By Chinese remainder theorem there exists such $x$. It is easy to see that none of $x + 1, x + 2, \dots, x + k$ are square free since for any $1 \le i \le k$ we have:
        $x \overset{p_i^2 }{\equiv } -i $ which implies $p_i^2 \mid x + i$. Therefore for any $k$ there exists $k$ consecutive number where none of them is square free.
