        Suppose $H$ is a normal subgroup of $D_{2n}$. If $H \subset \braket{r}$, then $H = \braket{r^i}$ such that $i \mid n$. And it is easy to see that for any element $\delta \in D_{2n}$ we have $\delta H \inv \delta = H$. Thus for any $i \mid n$, $\braket{r^i}$ is a normal subgroup of $D_{2n}$.
        Now suppose $H \not \subset \braket{r}$. Thus there exists a $sr^i \in H$. Since $H$ is normal we have $r (sr^i) \inv r  = sr^{i - 2}\in H$. This shows that if $n$ is odd, then $H$ contains all elements of form $sr^i$. Which are half of the elements of the group. With addition of 1, $H$ contains more than half of the $D_{2n}$, Which means that $H = D_{2n}$. Since if we want to write $D_{2n}$, as a direct product, then the two subgroups are both normal in $D_{2n}$, and it is easy that direct product of these normal subgroups for odd $n$, doesn't create $D_{2n}$, then for odd $n$ it is not possible to write $D_{2n}$ as a direct product. For even $n$, if $H \subset \braket{r}$ it is similar to the privious part. But if $sr^i \in H$, then with conjugation $sr^{i - 2} \in H$. This shows that $\braket{s, r^2} \subset H$. Which has exactly half of the elements of $D_{2n}$, therefore in order for $H$ to be a proper normal subgroup, we have $H = \braket{s, r^2}$. Note that this subgroup is the only normal subgroup of $D_{2n}$ such that it includes $s$. Thus if we want to write $D_{2n}$ as a direct product, one normal sbugroup is $\braket{s, r^2}$. And considering the size of group, the other subgroup must be of order 2. Let $t$ be an element with order 2. Thus we would have $D_{2n} = \braket{t} \times \braket{s, r^2}$. Therefore $D_{2n} = \braket{(t, s), (t, r^2)}$. Which implies $Ord((t, s)) = 2$ and $Ord((t, r^2)) = n$. We also know that $Ord((t, r^2)) = lcm(Ord(t), Ord(r^2)) = lcm(2, n/2)$. This shows that $n/2$ must be odd, in order for this direct product to create $D_{2n}$. Therefore if $n$ is of the form $2m$ where $m$ is odd, then $D_{2n}$ can be written as a direct product, otherwise it cannot.
