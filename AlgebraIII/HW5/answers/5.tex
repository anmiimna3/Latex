        Let $\varphi \in Hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_{30}, \ZZ_{21})$. Then $\varphi$ is a group homomorphism from $\ZZ_{30}$ to $\ZZ_{21}$. Let $r$ be the generator of $\ZZ_{30}$ having order 30. Then it must mapped to an element with order $s$ where $s \mid 30$. And since $s \mid 21$ then we can only have $s = 1, 3$. If $s = 3$, there are only two elements with order 3 in $\ZZ_{21}$, namely $7$ and $14$.
        Also since $R = \ZZ$ then if $\varphi$ is a homomorphism we have:
        \begin{gather*}
            \varphi(rm) = \varphi(m + \dots + m) = r \varphi(m) 
        \end{gather*}
        Thus $\varphi$ is also a module homomorphism. Therefore any module homomorphism from $\ZZ_{30}$ to $\ZZ_{21}$ is uniquely identified with $\varphi(1)$. And we have only 3 such homomorphism:
        \begin{gather*}
            \varphi(1) = 7 \implies \varphi(m) = 7m \pmod{21}\\
            \varphi(1) = 14 \implies \varphi(m) = 14m \pmod{21}\\
            \varphi(1) = 0 \implies \varphi(m) = m \pmod{21}
        \end{gather*}
        Which form a group of order 3, $\ZZ_3$. \\
        Now since any $\ZZ$-module homomorphism is uniquely identifined with $\varphi(1)$, and we have:
        \begin{gather*}
            \begin{rcases}
                \begin{split}
                    Ord_{\ZZ_n}(\varphi(1)) & \mid n \\
                    Ord_{\ZZ_n}(\varphi(1)) & \mid Ord_{\ZZ_m}(1) = m
                \end{split}
            \end{rcases} \implies Ord_{\ZZ_n}(\varphi(1)) \mid (n, m)
        \end{gather*}
        We only need to show that homomorphisms that map 1 to a members with order $r$ in $\ZZ_n$ where $r \mid (n, m)$ form the group $\ZZ_{(m, n)}$. Let $\sigma \in Hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_m, \ZZ_n)$, where $\sigma(1) = s$ and $Ord(s) = (m, n)$. Now it is easy to see that $\sigma^r(1) = \sigma^{r-1}(s) = \dots = s^r$.
        This shows that $Ord(\sigma) = Ord(s) = (m, n)$. On the otherhand the number of elements in $\ZZ_n$ such as $s$ where $Ord_{\ZZ_n}(s) \mid (n, m)$ is exactly $(m, n)$. This proves that $\sigma$ generates the whole group and thus we have:
        \begin{gather*}
            Hom_\ZZ(\ZZ_m, \ZZ_n) \cong \ZZ_{(m, n)}
        \end{gather*}
