        For this we show that for any $n \in \NN$, $\Sigma_n$ is countable. Which is true since any set in $\Sigma_n$ can be mapped to a predicate $T$, (Supposing we fix $(\exists y_1) (\forall y_2) \dots, (\exists y_n)$ and their position in the predicate), And we have only countable number of predicates since their characteristic function is computable. Now for any $n \in \NN$ we have that $\Sigma_n , \Pi_n \subset \Sigma_{n + 1}$. Which is countable. Now we know that all of the subsets of $\NN$ are an uncountable set, And if the statement in the problem is true, then union of some (countable) number of countable sets, is uncountable, which is not possible, This shows that the statement in the problem is wrong.
