\begin{enumerate}[label=]
    \item 
        Suppose we know there exists some $S \in \Sigma_n$ such that $S \notin \Pi_n$, And we have $P \in \Pi_n$ such that $P \notin \Sigma_n$. Therefore since $\Delta_n = \Sigma_n \cap \Pi_n$ we have $\Delta_n \subsetneq \Sigma_n , \Pi_n$. We also know that $\Sigma_{n - 1} \subsetneq \Sigma_n$, And since $\Sigma_{n - 1} \subset \Pi_n$, Thus we have $\Sigma_{n - 1} \subsetneq \Delta_n$. This proves the problem.
