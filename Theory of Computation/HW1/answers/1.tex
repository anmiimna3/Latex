This program increments $r_2$ and $r_3$ in each step. Once $r_1 = r_2$ the program terminates.
Since in the initial configuration we have $r_2 > r_1$ and in each step $r_2$ increases, the program never terminates.
\newline
If we want to make sure that the program terminates it would be enough to have $r_1 \ge r_2$.
