\begin{enumerate}[label=]
    \item  
        Suppose prime number in form of $3k + 2$ are finite. and are all $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k$.
        Let $A =p_1^2 p_2^2 \dots p_k^2 + 1$. Since this number if of form $3k + 2$ and is greater than all of $p_i$s then it must be composite. Suppose prime $p$ such that $p \mid A$. then $p \ne 3$ otherwise:
        \begin{gather*}
            3 \mid 3r + 2 \implies 3 \mid 2 
        \end{gather*}
        Which is a contradiction. Also if $p = 3r + 2$ then $p = p_i$ for some $1 \le i \le k$ then:
        \begin{gather*}
            p_i \mid p_1^2 p_2^2 \dots p_k^2 + 1 \implies p_i \mid 1
        \end{gather*}
        Which is a contradiction.
        then all of prime factors of $A$ are of the form $3k + 1$. but this also cannot happen since product of $3k + 1$ numbers is also a $3k + 1$ number. But $A$ is of form $3k + 2$. This contradiction shows that the number of primes in form of $3k + 2$ cannot be finite.
