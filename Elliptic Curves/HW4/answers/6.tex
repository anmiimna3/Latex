\begin{enumerate}[label=\ilabel]
    \item 
        First note that we know that $|\ |_p$ is non-archimedean, we show that if $\padic x \ne \padic y$ then $\padic{x + y} = \max \{ \padic x , \padic y \}$.
        WLOG suppose that $\padic x > \padic y$. we can write:
        \begin{gather*}
            \padic{x + y} \le \max \{\padic x, \padic y \} = \padic x 
        \end{gather*}
        We can also write:
        \begin{gather*}
            \padic x = \padic{x + y - y} \ge \max \{ \padic{x + y}, \padic{-y} \}
        \end{gather*}
        Now note that $\padic{-y} = \padic y$, and since we had $\padic x > \padic y$, then we have that $\max \{ \padic{x + y} , \padic{-y} \} = \padic{x + y}$. Then we have $\padic x = \padic{x + y}$ and the claim is proven.
        Now suppose that we have $a, b, c$, three numbers each representing one vertex of the triangle, then sides of this triangle have lengths: $\padic{a - b}, \padic{b - c}, \padic{a - c}$. If $\padic{a - b} = \padic{b - c}$, then we are done. Otherwise, by the fact proven above, we have that $\padic{a - c} = \padic{a - b + b - c}$, and since $\padic{a - b} \ne \padic{b - c}$, then $\padic{a - c} = \max \{\padic{a - b}, \padic{b - c} \}$, which gives us two equal sides of the triangle, and we are done!
