    \item 
        Note that the curve described in the problem is $F(x, y, z) = x^3 + axz^2 + bz^3 - y^2z$. Now first we show that $F$ is smooth iff we have $\Delta = 4a^3 + 27 b^2 \ne 0$. First suppose that $F$ is smooth, this means that:
        \begin{gather*}
                \pdv{F}{x} = 3x^2 + az^2 \hspace{1cm}
                \pdv{F}{y} = -2yz \hspace{1cm}
                \pdv{F}{z} = 3z^2 + 2axz - y^2 
        \end{gather*}
        at least one of the above is nonzero for any point in the curve.
