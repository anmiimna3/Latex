    \item 
		The point $(0, 1)$ always is on the curve, then we have to find the singular points on this curve (If there exists any). Let $F: y^2 = x^3 + x + 1$, if $F$ has a singular point $P = (x, y)$:
        \begin{gather*}
            \pdv{F}{x} = 3x^2 + 1 = 0 \hspace{1cm} \pdv{F}{y} = 2y = 0 \hspace{1cm} \pdv{F}{z} = 3z^2 + 2zx - y^2 = 0
        \end{gather*}    
        Then $y  = 0$ and $3x^2 = -1$:
        \begin{gather*}
            0 = x^3 + x + 1 \\
            \implies 0 = 3x^3 + 3x + 3 = (-1)x + 3x + 3  \implies x = -\frac{3}{2}
        \end{gather*}
        Meaning $3 (-\frac{3}{2})^2 + 1 \ezmod p 0$, since $p$ is odd:
        \begin{gather*}
            p \mid 3 (- \frac{3}{2})^2 + 1 = \frac{27}{4} + 1 \\
            \implies p \mid 27 + 4 = 31
        \end{gather*}
        Also we have:
        \begin{gather*}
            \pdv{F}{z} = 3z^2 + 2zx - y^2 = 3 + 2 (- \frac{3}{2}) - 0 = 0
        \end{gather*}
        Then if $P$ is a singular point, we must be in $\FF_{31}$, and for any other $p$, this is an elliptic curve over $\FF_p$. Notice that $p = 3$ is obviously fine since $3x^2 + 1$ can not be 0 in $\FF_3$, thus multiplying by $3$ is permitted.


	\item
		First we find it for $\FF_3$:\\
        The points are:
        \begin{gather*}
            (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), \mathcal O
        \end{gather*}
        And since we have two points of order $2$ and $(0, 1)$ is not of order 2, then the the group is $\ZZ/4\ZZ$. \\
        For $\FF_5$: \\
        The points are:
        \begin{gather*}
            (0, \pm 1), (2, \pm 1), (-2, \pm 1), (-1, \pm 2), \mathcal O
        \end{gather*}
        Which are $9$ points, we only need to show that there exists one point that doesn't have order 3, which for which we prove that (0, 1) is that point...
