    Below is the fiure of Herschel graph:

    \end{center}
    It is easy to see that with the removal of \textit{blue} vertices, the remaining graph is a disconnected and has 6 components (all \textit{red} vertices). By Theorem 6.5 in any Hamiltonian graph and any nontrivial subset of vertices $S$, we have that $k(G - S) \le |S|$, while in this graph if let $S$ be the set of \textit{blue} vertices, then $k(G - S) = 6 > 5 = |S|$, hence this graph is not Hamiltonian.
