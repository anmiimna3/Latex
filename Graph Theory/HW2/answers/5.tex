\begin{enumerate}[label=]
    \item
        Suppose $G$ is a directed graph and $G_1, G_2, \dots, G_k$ be strongly connected components of this graph. Suppose that all these components have outgoing edges. Then you can consider these components as vertices and we have a graph that each vertex has an outgoing edge. Let $P$ be the longest path in this graph which is formed by $v_1, \dots, v_i$. We know that $v_i$ has an outgoing edge. Since $P$ was the longest path, then $v_i$ can't be connected to a vertex out of $P$. Therefore we have a cylce since $v_i$ is connected to a vetex in $P$. Therefore there is a cycle between the strongly connected components of the graph. This means that from each of the components of the cycle there is a path to any other component in the cylce, which proves that all of them are a single component. Which is a contradiction. This shows that there exists a component that doesn't have an outgoing edge. The proof for the other part is exacly the same.
