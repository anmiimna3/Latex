    \item 
        let $\overline{F}$ be the splitting field of $f$ over $F$. now suppose $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are two roots of $f$ such that
        $\alpha_1$ is a root of $g_1$ and $\alpha_2$ is a root of $g_2$. by ismorphism extension theorem there exists a
        $\sigma: \overline{F} \to \overline{F}$ which is a $F-$automorphism and $\sigma(\alpha_1) = \alpha_2$.
        now let $\sigma_{|K} = \tau$. since $K$ is normal and $\tau: K \to \overline{F} \subset M$ where $M$ is the algebraic closure of $F$ it follows that $\tau(K) = K$ therefore $\tau \in \text{Gal}(K/F)$.
        now since $\alpha_2 = \tau(\alpha_1)$, then $min_{\alpha_2, K} = \tau(min_{\alpha_1, K})$ and since minimal polynomial of $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ over $K$ are $g_1$ and $g_2$ then we have:
        $\tau(g_1) = g_2$.
