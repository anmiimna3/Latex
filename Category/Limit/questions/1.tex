Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Prove that for any finite diagram $\mathcal{D}: \mathcal I \to \mathcal{C}$
there exists $\lim_{\leftarrow I} \mathcal D$ iff category $\mathcal C$ has a Terminal object and for any two morphisms with the same domain and codomain, there exists an Equalizer and also for any $A, B \in \mathcal C_0$, $A\times B \in \mathcal C_0$.
